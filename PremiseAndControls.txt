CSC 1351 FINAL PROJECT- CATCH THE SQUIRREL

Premise: Oh No! A squirrel has run off with your french fry once again! You must catch that squirrel before it gets away. 
Avoid obstacles as you collect powerups(fries) to get you closer to the squirrel. But avoid the obstacles, or you'll lose a life!

How the project works: This game works from an avoid the obstacles premise. If you hit any of the obstacles, you lose a life, and if you 
lose all three lives given to you, you must start the game over. However, you can get lives back by collecting hearts. Collect the fries to 
move closer to the squirrel. Good luck!
